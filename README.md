## Project Description
The EEG Brain State Analyzer is a real‑time web application that simulates and analyzes EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals to determine human brain states such as Relaxed, Focused/Stressed, and Sleepy.
The project demonstrates how raw brain signals, which exist in the time domain, can be transformed into meaningful frequency‑based brain activity insights using signal processing techniques.
